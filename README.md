# ğŸ§  JavaScript ES6+ Exercises

Welcome to my collection of introductory **JavaScript ES6+ practice exercises**.  
These tasks cover the essentials of modern JavaScript, from variables and functions to objects, arrays, destructuring, and template literals.

All exercises were built with a focus on **clarity, reusability, and understanding the core features** of the language.

## ğŸ“¦ Exercises

### ğŸ”¹ Variables  
Declared constants and variables (`const`, `let`), initialized values, and calculated the area of a circle.

### ğŸ”¹ Arrow Functions  
Created a concise arrow function `esPar` to check if a number is even.

### ğŸ”¹ Objects  
Defined a `persona` object with properties (`nombre`, `edad`, `profesion`) and accessed them with `console.log`.

### ğŸ”¹ Arrays  
Worked with arrays and loops to compute the square of each number.

### ğŸ”¹ JSON  
Practiced converting objects to JSON with `JSON.stringify` and back with `JSON.parse`.

### ğŸ”¹ Destructuring  
Extracted object properties and array elements directly with ES6 destructuring.

### ğŸ”¹ Spread Operator  
Merged two arrays (`pares` and `impares`) into one combined array.

### ğŸ”¹ Rest Operator  
Implemented a `sumar` function that takes unlimited arguments and adds them using `reduce`.

### ğŸ”¹ Template Literals  
Used backticks to create dynamic strings with embedded variables.

### ğŸ”¹ Complete Integration  
Created a `coche` object, used destructuring, combined arrays with spread,  
and wrote a function to return a string of car names using `map` and `join`.
